    2D Matrix Path with Restrictions

    Given a 2D (X * Y) matrix with N bombs located at (xi, yi)ï¼Œ where 0 < X, Y, N <= 1000.
    start = [0][0]
    end = [X - 1][Y - 1]
    Find the shortest path from start to end which has the maximum d_shortest,
    where d_shortest denotes the shortest Manhattan distance between the bomb and the path.

    Example:
    N = 2
    Location: (1, 2), (2, 3).
    output: 9(shortest path length), 2(shortest distance)

    I - BFS, find all paths and calculate the shortest distance.
    Int - Let 0 < X, Y, N, <= 1000. Is your algorithm acceptable?
    I - (X * Y) ** 2.
    Int - Sure?
    I - Wrong, should be exponential complexity, like 4 ** (X + Y).
    Int - Yes, how to optimize it?

    Think.

    I - No ideas, any remind?
    Int - How to calculate one point's shortest distance to the bombs?
    I - Generate one matrix for one bomb, denoting this distance, O(XYN). s1, get mat[][].
        When traversing, at each point, we check N matrices and find the shortest distance, O(N). s2
    Int - Can we only use ONE auxiliary matrix?
    I - Yes, we traverse all bombs and update the distance matrix if we find a smaller value at s1.
        Then s2's complexity will be O(1).

    Think.
    I - Reminds please.
    Int - What if we know 2 is the shortest distance, and let you find the path?
    I - We traverse mat and block points whose value < 2.
    Int - Right, so what if we do not know 2?
    I - We can try from the maximal distance to 0, if we find the path, then we break and return.
    Int Right, complexity?
    I - O(XY * (X + Y)), cubic complexity.
    Int - Right, try to implement your ideas.
